# Network Packet Tracking System

This project is a network packet tracking system designed to monitor incoming and outgoing packets on a computer. It is implemented using PHP for server-side processing, jQuery for client-side interactivity, and jqPlot for generating statistical graphs. Additionally, shell scripts are utilized to collect packets and store them in a text file for analysis.

## Features

- **Packet Collection**: Shell scripts are used to collect incoming and outgoing packets on the computer and store them in a text file.
- **Server-Side Processing**: PHP scripts handle the processing of packet data and generate statistical insights.
- **Client-Side Visualization**: jQuery and jqPlot are used to create interactive graphs and visualizations of packet statistics.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system provides real-time updates on packet traffic, allowing users to monitor network activity effectively.

## Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Packet Collection Scripts**: Shell scripts responsible for capturing incoming and outgoing packets and storing them in a text file.
2. **PHP Backend**: for processing packet data, generating statistics, and serving the data to the client.
3. **Client Interface**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files providing the user interface for interacting with the system.
4. **jqPlot Library**: JavaScript library (`jqplot.js`) used for creating statistical graphs and visualizations.
5. **Dependencies**: Other necessary dependencies such as jQuery (`jquery.js`).

## Usage

- Navigate through the interface to view real-time statistics and graphs of incoming and outgoing packets.
- Analyze the packet data to identify patterns, anomalies, or network issues.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any enhancements, bug fixes, or new features to propose, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Notes

- This project is intended for educational purposes and network analysis. Ensure compliance with legal and ethical considerations when monitoring network traffic.
- Customize the packet collection and processing scripts according to your specific network configuration and requirements.
